# Magisk

## Building Environment Requirements

1. Python 3.5+: run `build.py` script
2. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8: Compile Magisk Manager and sign zips
3. Latest Android SDK: set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the path to Android SDK
4. Android NDK: Install NDK along with SDK (`$ANDROID_HOME/ndk-bundle`), or optionally specify a custom path `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`
5. (Windows Only) Python package Colorama: Install with `pip install colorama`, used for ANSI color codes

## Building Notes and Instructions
1. Building is tested on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows 10 using the latest stable NDK and NDK r10e. Officially released binaries were built with NDK r10e.
2. Set configurations in `config.prop`. A sample file `config.prop.sample` is provided as an example.
3. Run `build.py` with argument `-h` to see the built-in help message. The `-h` option also works for each supported actions, e.g. `./build.py binary -h`
4. By default, `build.py` build binaries and Magisk Manager in debug mode. If you want to build Magisk Manager in release mode (via the `--release` flag), you need a Java Keystore file `release-key.jks` to sign Magisk Manager's APK. For more information, check out [Google's Official Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#signing-manually).
5. The SafetyNet extension pack requires the full Magisk Manager as a `compileOnly` dependency. Build the **release** APK, convert it back to Java `.class` files (I use [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar)), and place the converted JAR under `snet/libs` before compiling.
